# Wyoming Piper

[Wyoming protocol](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming) server for the [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/) text to speech system.

## About this fork

This fork is quick hacky fix of [wyoming-piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-piper) because it is broken with piper-tts==1.3.0

This is a slow workaround for [an incompatiblity](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl/issues/28)

Check the README of the original repo, use this only until it is fixed in a proper way (using Python API, not command line invocation)
